ANSWERS-

Scenario 1: Methodology Selection

The main differences between the testing methodologies are as follows:

Black Box Testing: Testers have no prior knowledge of the system. This simulates an external attacker's perspective, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities without any internal information.
White Box Testing: Testers have full access to the system's internals, including source code and architecture. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of the system's security controls.
Gray Box Testing: Testers have partial knowledge of the system, mimicking an insider's knowledge. This strikes a balance between external and internal viewpoints.
Given that the e-commerce company is concerned about external threats to their online platform, the Black Box methodology would be most suitable. It will help identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers who have no insider knowledge of the system.

Scenario 2: Web Application Penetration Testing

Key steps in web application penetration testing:

Authentication and Authorization Testing: Verify the effectiveness of authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Data Validation and Input Testing: Check how the application handles user inputs and validate against potential injection attacks.
Session Management Testing: Assess the security of session management and token handling.
Business Logic Testing: Test the application's logic to identify vulnerabilities that might not be apparent through automated scans.
Reporting: Compile a comprehensive report detailing vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommended fixes.
Common web vulnerabilities to test for: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF (cross-site request forgery), insecure authentication mechanisms, insecure session management, and more.

Scenario 3: Insider Threat Assessment

To uncover insider threats:

User Activity Monitoring: Monitor user actions and behavior for anomalies.
Access Controls Testing: Verify that access controls prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
